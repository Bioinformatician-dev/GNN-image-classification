# GNN-image-classification
GNNs can be used to classify images based on the relationships between different image features.
## Install Required Libraries
Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed:

```bash
 pip install torch torchvision torch-geometric
```

## Instructions:
*Prepare the  Data: Replace the dataset and preprocessing with your desired images if necessary.

* Graph Construction: In a more complex scenario, you would create edges based on pixel similarity or spatial relationships, rather than just self-connections.

* Run the Code: Save the script as image_classification.py and execute it.

  ```bash
  python image_classification.py
```
